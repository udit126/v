## The Building Blocks: Points, Lines, and Planes

Geometry begins with three undefined terms: point, line, and plane. These are the fundamental concepts upon which all other geometric ideas are built.

*   **Point:** A point is a location in space. It has no size or dimension and is usually represented by a dot. We often label points with capital letters, like point A, point B, and point C.

*   **Line:** A line is a straight, one-dimensional figure that extends infinitely in both directions. It's defined by two points. We can name a line by any two points on it (e.g., line AB or line BA) or by a lowercase letter (e.g., line l).

*   **Plane:** A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It's defined by three non-collinear (not on the same line) points. Planes are often named by three points on the plane (e.g., plane ABC) or by a capital script letter (e.g., plane P).

## Angles: Measuring Rotation

An angle is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint called the vertex. Angles are measured in degrees or radians.

*   **Types of Angles:**
    *   **Acute Angle:** An angle that measures between 0° and 90°.
    *   **Right Angle:** An angle that measures exactly 90°.
    *   **Obtuse Angle:** An angle that measures between 90° and 180°.
    *   **Straight Angle:** An angle that measures exactly 180°.
    *   **Reflex Angle:** An angle that measures between 180° and 360°.

*   **Angle Relationships:**
    *   **Complementary Angles:** Two angles whose measures add up to 90°.
    *   **Supplementary Angles:** Two angles whose measures add up to 180°.
    *   **Vertical Angles:** Two angles formed by intersecting lines that are opposite each other. Vertical angles are congruent (equal in measure).
    *   **Adjacent Angles:** Two angles that share a common vertex and a common side but do not overlap.

## Shapes: From Triangles to Circles

Geometry is full of shapes, each with unique properties and characteristics. Let's explore some fundamental two-dimensional shapes:

### Triangles

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. The sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180°.

*   **Types of Triangles Based on Sides:**
    *   **Equilateral Triangle:** All three sides are equal in length, and all three angles are equal (60° each).
    *   **Isosceles Triangle:** Two sides are equal in length, and the angles opposite those sides are equal.
    *   **Scalene Triangle:** All three sides are different lengths, and all three angles are different measures.

*   **Types of Triangles Based on Angles:**
    *   **Acute Triangle:** All three angles are acute (less than 90°).
    *   **Right Triangle:** One angle is a right angle (90°). The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called legs. The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) applies to right triangles, where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the legs and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.
    *   **Obtuse Triangle:** One angle is obtuse (greater than 90°).

### Quadrilaterals

A quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides and four angles. The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is always 360°.

*   **Types of Quadrilaterals:**
    *   **Square:** All four sides are equal in length, and all four angles are right angles.
    *   **Rectangle:** Opposite sides are equal in length, and all four angles are right angles.
    *   **Parallelogram:** Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and opposite angles are equal.
    *   **Rhombus:** All four sides are equal in length, and opposite angles are equal.
    *   **Trapezoid:** Only one pair of opposite sides is parallel.

### Circles

A circle is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a central point.

*   **Key Circle Terms:**
    *   **Center:** The central point of the circle.
    *   **Radius:** The distance from the center to any point on the circle.
    *   **Diameter:** The distance across the circle through the center (twice the radius).
    *   **Circumference:** The distance around the circle (C = 2πr or C = πd, where r is the radius and d is the diameter).
    *   **Area:** The space enclosed by the circle (A = πr²).
    *   **Chord:** A line segment that connects two points on the circle.
    *   **Tangent:** A line that touches the circle at only one point.
    *   **Secant:** A line that intersects the circle at two points.

## Solid Geometry: Exploring Three Dimensions

Solid geometry deals with three-dimensional shapes, also known as solids.

*   **Polyhedrons:** Three-dimensional shapes with flat faces. Examples include cubes, prisms, and pyramids.

*   **Prisms:** Polyhedrons with two congruent and parallel bases connected by rectangular faces.

*   **Pyramids:** Polyhedrons with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common vertex.

*   **Spheres:** A three-dimensional shape where every point on the surface is equidistant from the center.

*   **Cylinders:** A three-dimensional shape with two congruent and parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface.

*   **Cones:** A three-dimensional shape with a circular base and a curved surface that tapers to a single point called the apex.

## Congruence and Similarity

*   **Congruence:** Two figures are congruent if they have the same size and shape. In other words, you can transform one figure into the other by a combination of translations, rotations, and reflections.

*   **Similarity:** Two figures are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Similar figures have corresponding angles that are congruent and corresponding sides that are proportional.

## Transformations: Moving and Changing Shapes

Geometric transformations are operations that change the position or size of a figure.

*   **Translations:** Sliding a figure without changing its size or orientation.
*   **Reflections:** Flipping a figure over a line (the line of reflection).
*   **Rotations:** Turning a figure around a point (the center of rotation).
*   **Dilations:** Enlarging or shrinking a figure by a scale factor.

## Coordinate Geometry: Bridging Algebra and Geometry

Coordinate geometry, also known as analytic geometry, uses a coordinate system (usually the Cartesian coordinate system) to represent geometric shapes and figures with algebraic equations.

*   **The Cartesian Coordinate System:** Consists of two perpendicular number lines (the x-axis and the y-axis) that intersect at a point called the origin (0, 0).

*   **Distance Formula:** Used to calculate the distance between two points in the coordinate plane. If the points are (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), the distance is: √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²).

*   **Midpoint Formula:** Used to find the midpoint of a line segment. If the endpoints are (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), the midpoint is: ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2).

*   **Slope:** A measure of the steepness of a line. It is defined as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between two points on the line. The slope (m) is calculated as: m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁).

*   **Equations of Lines:**
    *   **Slope-intercept form:** y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
    *   **Point-slope form:** y - y₁ = m(x - x₁), where m is the slope and (x₁, y₁) is a point on the line.
    *   **Standard form:** Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are constants.

## Real-World Applications

Geometry is not just an abstract mathematical concept; it has countless applications in the real world.

*   **Architecture:** Architects use geometry to design buildings, ensuring stability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal.

*   **Engineering:** Engineers rely on geometry for designing bridges, roads, machines, and other structures.

*   **Computer Graphics:** Geometry is fundamental to creating realistic images and animations in video games, movies, and virtual reality.

*   **Art:** Artists use geometric principles, such as perspective and symmetry, to create visually appealing and balanced compositions.

*   **Navigation:** Geometry is used in GPS systems and other navigation technologies to determine locations and routes.
