## The Many Faces of "Course" in Spanish

The English word "course" can refer to several different things, which is why there isn't a single, direct translation in Spanish. Here's a breakdown of the most common translations and their specific usages:

**1. *Curso* (Academic Course, Class):**

This is arguably the most common and versatile translation of "course" in Spanish. It primarily refers to an academic course of study, a class, or a program.

*   **Usage:** *Curso* is used when discussing subjects studied in school, university, or any formal learning environment. It can also refer to a training program or workshop.

When referring to a course in a meal (appetizer, main course, dessert), the word *plato* is used.
