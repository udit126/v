## What is Spiritual Life Coaching?

Spiritual life coaching is a distinct approach to personal development that goes beyond traditional life coaching. While conventional life coaching focuses on setting and achieving goals in areas like career, relationships, and finances, spiritual life coaching integrates spiritual principles, values, and practices to address the deeper questions of meaning, purpose, and connection. It acknowledges the spiritual dimension of human existence and helps individuals connect with their inner wisdom, intuition, and higher power (whatever that may mean to them).

In essence, spiritual life coaching is about:

*   **Self-Discovery:** Uncovering your true values, beliefs, and purpose in life.

*   **Spiritual Growth:** Developing your spiritual awareness and connection.
*   **Transformative Change:** Creating lasting positive change in your life by addressing the root causes of challenges.
