Given that "DTI-1001" doesn't align with widely known financial acronyms or formulas, we can approach it from several perspectives:

*   **Internal Code:** It could be an internal code or designation used by a specific financial institution, company, or regulatory body to refer to a particular product, process, or compliance requirement. Without knowing the origin of this code, it's challenging to pinpoint its exact meaning.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** The "DTI" portion might allude to regulatory compliance related to derivatives trading or other financial instruments. Regulations often require institutions to track and report specific data points, and "1001" could be a segment within a larger reporting framework.
