## What is Personal Mastery?

Personal mastery is more than just acquiring skills or achieving goals. It's a holistic approach to self-development that encompasses your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. It's about developing a deep understanding of yourself, your values, and your purpose in life. It's about cultivating the habits, skills, and mindset needed to achieve your goals and live a fulfilling life.

Peter Senge, in his book "The Fifth Discipline," describes personal mastery as a discipline that "goes beyond competence and skills." He emphasizes that it's about "continually clarifying and deepening our personal vision, of focusing our energies, of developing patience, and of seeing reality objectively."
