*   **Realize Your Designs:** No longer limited by existing patterns, you can bring your unique designs to life.
*   **Achieve a Perfect Fit:** Customize patterns to your specific measurements and body shape, ensuring a flattering and comfortable fit.
*   **Understand Garment Construction:** Deepen your understanding of how garments are put together, enabling you to troubleshoot problems and create more complex designs.
*   **Develop a Valuable Skill:** Patternmaking is a highly sought-after skill in the fashion industry, opening doors to various career opportunities.
*   **Create a Sustainable Wardrobe:** Design and sew your own clothes, reducing your reliance on fast fashion and creating garments that are built to last.

## Types of Patternmaking Classes in NYC

NYC offers a diverse range of patternmaking classes, catering to different interests, skill levels, and learning styles. Here's a breakdown of some common types:

*   **Flat Patternmaking:** This method involves manipulating existing patterns to create new designs. It's a faster and more efficient approach than drafting, but requires a good understanding of patternmaking principles.
*   **Digital Patternmaking:** This modern approach uses computer-aided design (CAD) software to create and modify patterns. It's becoming increasingly popular in the fashion industry, offering greater precision and efficiency.
*   **Specialty Patternmaking:** These classes focus on specific types of garments, such as knitwear, swimwear, or bridalwear. They provide specialized knowledge and techniques for creating these garments.
