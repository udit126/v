## What is Restorative Yoga?

Restorative yoga is a practice that utilizes props to support the body in comfortable, passive poses. These poses are held for extended periods, typically 5-20 minutes each, allowing the body to relax deeply and activate the parasympathetic nervous system â€“ the "rest and digest" system. Unlike more active styles of yoga, restorative yoga requires no muscular effort. The focus is on surrender, allowing gravity to do the work and gently releasing tension held in the body and mind.

## Benefits of Restorative Yoga

The benefits of restorative yoga are far-reaching, impacting both physical and mental well-being:

*   **Reduces Stress and Anxiety:** By activating the parasympathetic nervous system, restorative yoga calms the mind, reduces cortisol levels (the stress hormone), and promotes feelings of peace and tranquility.

*   **Improves Sleep Quality:** Regular restorative yoga practice can help regulate the sleep-wake cycle and improve sleep quality by reducing stress and promoting relaxation.

*   **Relieves Muscle Tension:** Supported poses allow muscles to release deeply held tension, reducing pain and stiffness.

*   **Boosts Immunity:** By reducing stress and promoting relaxation, restorative yoga can help strengthen the immune system.

*   **Enhances Body Awareness:** As you settle into each pose, you become more attuned to your body's sensations, fostering a deeper connection to yourself.

*   **Supports Healing and Recovery:** Restorative yoga can be beneficial for individuals recovering from injuries, illness, or trauma.

*   **Increases Energy Levels:** While it may seem counterintuitive, deep rest and relaxation can actually boost energy levels by reducing stress and improving overall well-being.
